## Patterns Overview

### Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is a technique for efficiently processing arrays or lists by maintaining a subset of elements within a 'window.' This section covers common problems and solutions related to the Sliding Window pattern.

### Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique involves maintaining two pointers that traverse an array or sequence at different speeds. Discover various problems and solutions related to the Two Pointers pattern in this section.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems. Explore dynamic programming solutions and concepts in this section.

### Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element in a sorted collection. Dive into problems and solutions that leverage the Binary Search pattern.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search is a fundamental graph traversal technique. This section delves into DFS-related problems and solutions.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search is another essential graph traversal technique, exploring problems and solutions associated with BFS.
